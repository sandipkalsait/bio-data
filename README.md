# Marriage Profile Showcase (Fun Project)

This is a fun React project to showcase personal profiles for marriage purposes. The project demonstrates the use of a `data/data.json` file to manage and render profile details dynamically.

## Features

- Dynamically rendered profiles using JSON data.
- Interactive and responsive UI.
- Supports personal details, images, and family information.

## Example Data Structure

Hereâ€™s a sample `data.json` file:

```json
{
    "personalDetails": {
      "name": "Sandip Kalsait",
      "age": 24,
      "profession": "Software Engineer",
      "location": "Pune, Maharashtra",
      "aboutMe": "A passionate individual who loves to explore new places and cultures.",
      "family": {
        "father": "Navnath Kalsait",
        "mother": "Laxmi Kalsait",
        "siblings": "One younger sister, studying in Pune."
      },
      "interests": ["Traveling", "Cooking", "Reading"],
      "values": "Believes in family values, mutual respect, and love.",
      "lookingFor": "A partner who is kind, supportive, and shares similar values."
    },
    "images": {
      "primary": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/75.jpg",
      "others": [
        "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/1.jpg",
        "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/2.jpg",

      ]
    }
}
```
